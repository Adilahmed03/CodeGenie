                """
                This program will print the numbers from 1 to 10
                """
                # Using a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 1 to 10
                for i in range(1, 11):
                    # Print the current number
                    print(i)
                ---------------------------
                # Note: The print statement can be on its own line for better readability
                # if preferred.
                # Also, the range function can be written as range(1, 11) or as range(10)
                # depending on the desired output range.
                # However, it's important to note that range(10) will only output numbers from 0 to 9,
                # so we need to add 1 to the output to get numbers from 1 to 10.
                # Therefore, the recommended way is to write it as range(1, 11).
